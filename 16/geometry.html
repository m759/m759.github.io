<strong>Notes by Steven H. Cullinane

<p><strong><font size="4">A Structure-Endowed
Entity</font></strong>
</p>

</center>

<p>
"A guiding principle in modern mathematics is this lesson: <em>Whenever
you have to do with a structure-endowed entity S, try to determine its
group of automorphisms</em>,
the group of those element-wise transformations which leave all
structural relations undisturbed.&nbsp; You can expect to gain a
deep
insight into the constitution of S in this way."
</p>

<p>
-- Hermann Weyl in <em>Symmetry</em>
</p>

<p>
Let us apply Weyl's lesson to the following "structure-endowed entity."
</p>

<p align="center">
<img alt="4x4 array of dots" src="geometry_files/031109-dots4x4.gif" /></p>

<p align="left">
What is the order of the resulting group of automorphisms?
</p>

<p align="left">
First, of course, we must determine exactly what "structural relations"
we wish to leave undisturbed.
</p>

<p align="left">
Trivially, the overall 4x4 structure is left undistubed by <em>any
</em>permutation
of the sixteen dots.&nbsp; But not all <em>sub</em>structures
are left undistubed by an arbitrary permutation.&nbsp; For example,
the
set of four rows and the set of four columns are left undisturbed by
permutations of rows and/or columns, but not by permutations of the
four 2x2 quadrants.</p>

<p align="left">We may be interested in permutations that
preserve the
structural
relation of <em>adjacency</em>.&nbsp; In this case, it
turns out that
the group of
symmetries of the four-dimensional hypercube, or tesseract,
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="geometry_files/Tess06.gif" /></p>

<p align="left">
is what we are looking for, since <a href="adjacency.html">it is well-known</a> that adjacency in
the hypercube is equivalent to adjacency in a 4x4 array-- provided we
regard the array as drawn on a <i>torus</i>, so that <i>each</i>
element of the array is adjacent to four other elements.&nbsp; The
hypercube's symmetry group is of <a href="http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/%7Eschultz/3P5.2000/3P5.20N-Cube.html">
order 384</a>.
</p>

<p align="left">
We may, however, be interested in structural relations other than
adjacency.&nbsp; For instance, we may be interested in families of
subsets of the sixteen dots.</p>

<p align="left">One such family, the 6-sets of the <span style="font-style: italic;">(16</span><sub style="font-style: italic;"><small>6</small></sub><span style="font-style: italic;">, 16</span><sub style="font-style: italic;"><small>6</small></sub><span style="font-style: italic;">) Kummer configuration</span>,
<a href="geometry_files/Carmichael42-43.jpg">was discussed</a> (without naming it as such) by R.D. Carmichael in 1937.
For that configuration, see this website's note on <a href="../gen/configs.html">Configurations
and Squares</a>. &nbsp;Carmichael's 1937 classic,&nbsp;<em>Introduction
to the Theory of Groups of Finite Order</em>, seems, however, to have overlooked an even more interesting family of subsets. </p>

<p align="left">It turns out that if we regard the
4x4 array as a picture of the affine space of four dimensions over the
two-element field, a very natural family of subsets is provided by the
35 partitions of the space into four parallel affine planes <nobr>--</nobr>
that is to say, into the 35 two-dimensional linear subspaces of a
corresponding vector space and their cosets under translations. The
illustration below shows these 35 structures.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="geometry_files/The35.gif" /></p>

<p align="center">Aficionados of T. S. Eliot may, if they
like,<br />

call the
four-element planes or cosets "quartets."
</p>

<p align="left">
For a description of how the 4x4 array can be coordinatized to yield
this family of partitions and also a group of 322,560 permutations
(rather than the measly 384 of the hypercube) that leave <em>affine</em>&nbsp;"structural
relations" undisturbed, see <a href="finiterelat.html">Finite
Relativity</a>.
</p>

<p align="center">
<img alt="Coordinates for the 4x4 space" src="geometry_files/Coord.gif" /></p>

<p align="left">
Strangely enough, this rather obvious geometric picture <nobr>--</nobr>
that of the linear four-space over the two-element field as a 4x4 array
<nobr>--</nobr>
seems to have been completely overlooked in the refereed literature,
except for its occurrence in the "miracle octad generator" (MOG)
devised by R. T. Curtis<b>*</b> in his study of the Mathieu
group M<sub>24</sub>.&nbsp;
Even in that occurrence, the 4x4 parts of Curtis's 4x6 MOG arrays were
neither supplied with coordinates nor, indeed, explicitly identified as
possessing the structure of a finite geometry (although the appropriate
<nobr>group --</nobr> which provides a nice solution to
Weyl's problem <nobr>above
--</nobr> was described, albeit in a non-geometric manner).
</p>

<p>
The Curtis MOG is a pairing of 35 partitions of a 4x4 array into
four-sets (which turn out, once the array has been suitably
coordinatized as a linear space, to be the cosets, under translation,
of the 35 two-dimensional linear subspaces) with the 35 partitions of
an eight-set (shown as an array of four rows and two columns) into two
four-sets.&nbsp; This pairing is not arbitrary; it is preserved
under
the action of the 244,823,040 permutations of the
<a href="http://for.mat.bham.ac.uk/atlas/html/M24.html">large
Mathieu
group </a> M<sub>24</sub> acting on an array of four
rows
and six columns.&nbsp; See published descriptions* of the MOG for
details.
</p>

<p>
Within one of the maximal subgroups (a "brick stabilizer") of M<sub>24</sub>,
each of the 322,560 affine transformations of the 4x4 array is
accompanied
by a related M<sub>24</sub>
action (the identity, if the affine transformation is a translation) on
an associated 4x2 array, or "brick," of the MOG.&nbsp; These group
actions illustrate
<a href="http://www.ria.ie/publications/journals/procai/1999/PA99I2/PDF/99201AI.PDF">the
well-known isomorphism</a> (pdf) of the alternating group on
eight
elements,
A<sub>8</sub>, with the general linear group, GL(4,2), on
the
four-space
over the two-element field.

      <td valign="top">
      <center><b><font size="4">How the MOG
Works</font></b></center>

      <font size="2">
      <p>The quintuply transitive Mathieu group M<sub>24</sub>
is the
automorphism group
of the set of octads, or 8-sets, generated by
the Curtis Miracle Octad
Generator (MOG).&nbsp; (See Peter J. Cameron's <a href="http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/%7Epjc/pps/pps9.pdf">Geometry
of the Mathieu Groups</a> (pdf).)<br />

      <br />

There are 759 such octads: <br />

      <br />

(7 * 2 * 2 * 3) + (28 * 2 * 4 * 3) + 3 =
759,<br />

      <br />

or, in symbols,<br />

      <br />

(A * B * C * D) + ( E * F * G * H) + I = 759. <br />

      <br />

Where the above numbers come from:<br />

      <br />

Each octad occurs within a 24-set: an array of 4 rows and 6
columns.&nbsp; This 4x6 array is made up of three 4x2
completely&nbsp;
interchangeable "bricks." </p>

      <p align="center"><img src="geometry_files/MOGbricks.gif" /></p>

Each brick, considered by itself, is an octad.&nbsp; Hence the "I"
value of 3,
for the 3 individual bricks.
      <p align="center"><img src="geometry_files/MOGoctadform.jpg" /> </p>

A non-brick octad is formed by selecting 4 similarly marked
locations (all black or all white) within one of the 35 4x2 MOG
pictures, and 4 similarly marked locations (all black, all white, all
circles, or all dots) in the corresponding 4x4 MOG picture, then
applying a permutation (possibly the identity) of the three bricks of
the resulting 4x6 array.<br />

      <br />

Apart from the octads that are themselves bricks, the 8 cells that
define an octad may occur in a 4 + 4 + 0 (or 4 + 0 + 4 or 0 + 4 + 4)
pattern within the three bricks. or they may occur in a 4 + 2 + 2
(or 2 + 4 + 2 or 2 + 2 + 4) pattern within the three bricks.<br />

      <br />

In the 4 + 4 + 0, etc., case, one of the two nonempty bricks
in a 4x6 array contains 4 cells (either the four white or the four
black cells) from one of the 7 bricks pictured in the leftmost column
of the MOG picture, which can be chosen in 2 ways (hence "A" and "B"),
and the other nonempty brick contains 4 cells (any 4 cells marked
alike) from the corresponding picture in column 6 of the MOG; these 4
cells can fall within <i>this</i> nonempty brick in
exactly 2 ways
(hence "C").&nbsp; Switching the two nonempty bricks adds no new
octads.&nbsp;
The third, empty, brick can fall in any of the
three brick positions (hence "D").<br />

      <br />

In the 4 + 2 + 2, etc., case, one of the 3 bricks, the "heavy" brick,
contains 4 elements of the octad.&nbsp; This can fall within any of
the
three brick positions (hence "H").&nbsp; There are clearly 28 * 2
choices (from the MOG pictures in columns 2 through 5) for the 4
elements of the heavy brick (hence "E" and "F").&nbsp; Paired with
each
of these choices are 4 ways of selecting the "2 + 2" elements in the
other two bricks, based
on the sets of 4 like elements in each of the MOG pictures in columns 7
through 10 (hence "G").&nbsp; Switching the two "2 + 2" bricks adds
no
new octads. </font></td>

<p>The Curtis MOG plays a prominent role in the book
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/3540627782/"><i>Twelve
Sporadic Groups</i></a>, by
<a href="http://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/people/faculty/griessR.shtml">Robert
L. Griess</a>, which discusses some of the groups involved in
Griess's
Monster.<b>**</b>&nbsp; A picture of a MOG action
appears on
<a href="geometry_files/TwelveSG.jpg">the
book's cover</a>.&nbsp;

Rowley</a>. </p>

<p align="left">
For a description of how the 4x4 array also provides a nice picture of
the 35 <em>lines</em> in the finite <em>projective</em>
space PG(3,2) (as well as the 35 <em>planes through a point</em>
in the finite <em>affine</em> space AG(4,2)), see
<a href="../gen/ortho.html">Orthogonal
Latin
Squares as Skew Lines</a>.
</p>

<p>In fact, the MOG has an ancestor in the literature of finite
projective geometry. A pairing equivalent to that in the MOG was
described (though without the rectangular arrays devised by Curtis) in
a paper on the projective space PG(3,2) published in 1910.&nbsp;
See
page 72 of <a href="http://www.genealogy.ams.org/html/id.phtml?id=1486">
G. M. Conwell</a>'s "The 3-Space PG(3,2) and Its Group," Ann. of
Math.
11 (1910), 60-76.</p>

<p>
The relevant result is as follows:
</p>

<p>
"There exists a bijective correspondence between the 35 lines of
PG(3,2) and the 35 unordered triples in a 7-set such that lines are
concurrent if and only if the corresponding triples have exactly one
element in common."
</p>

-- Elisabeth Kuijken, <a href="http://cage.ugent.be/%7Enick/Theses/ekuijken.ps">Thesis</a>
(ps), March 2003.
</p>

<p>Kuijken cites Conwell as the source of this result. The result
may
be verified by examining the MOG illustration above in light of the
note <a href="../gen/ortho.html">Orthogonal
Latin Squares as Skew Lines</a>.
</p>
