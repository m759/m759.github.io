following note was suggested by W. D. Joyner's discussion of the
(vertex) "cross group" in his <i><a href="http://cadigweb.ew.usna.edu/%7Ewdj/books.html">Mathematics
of the Rubik's Cube</a></i>.&nbsp; Taken together with <a href="plane.html">The Eightfold Cube</a>,&nbsp; the note suggests a
visual explanation of why two embodiments of Klein's order-168 simple
group-- PSL(2, 7) and GL(3, 2)-- are
isomorphic.&nbsp; The "knight moves" of the title are not those of
chess, but are instead derived from a labeling of the subcubes of the
2x2x2 (eightfold) cube based on the Singer 7-cycle defined in <a href="../24/gentheog2.html">Generating the Octad Generator</a>:<br />

"Beauty is
the proper conformity of the parts to one another and to the whole."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;
-- Werner Heisenberg, "<i>Die Bedeutung des Schönen </i><i>in der
exakten Naturwissenschaft</i>," address delivered to the Bavarian
Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, 9 Oct. 1970,
reprinted in Heisenberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0918024811/" target="_new"><i>Across the Frontiers</i></a>, translated by Peter
Heath, Harper &amp; Row, 1974<br />
<br />
</span></span>"After the analysis which discovers the second quality
[symmetry,
following wholeness] the mind makes the only possible synthesis and
discovers the third quality [claritas or radiance]. This is the moment
which I call epiphany. First we recognise that the object is <i>one</i>
integral thing, then we recognise that it is an organised composite
structure, a <i>thing</i>
in fact: finally, when the relation of the parts is exquisite, when the
parts are adjusted to the special point, we recognise that it is <i>that</i>
thing which it is. Its soul, its whatness, leaps to us from the
vestment of its appearance. The soul of the commonest object, the
structure of which is so adjusted, seems to us radiant. The object
achieves its epiphany."<br />

</span></span><span><span>"Then the examination of the cube,
especially its surfaces, edges, and angles, which any child can observe
for himself, suggest [<i>sic</i>] new sensations and their resulting
perceptions. At the same time, notions of space, time, form, motion,
relativity in general, take their place in the mind, as the unshaped
blocks which, when fitly compacted together, will lay the firm
foundation of the understanding. These elementary notions, as the very
groundwork of mathematics, will be seen to have their use as time goes
on.</span></span><br />
<span><span></span></span><br />
<span><span>The third Gift is a large cube, making a whole, which is
divisible into eight small ones. The form is recognized as that of the
cube before seen; the size is different. But the new experiences
consist in notions of relativity-- of the whole in its relation to the
parts, of the parts in their relation to the whole; and thus the child
acquires the notion and the names, and both in immediate connection
with the sensible objects, of halves, quarters, eighths, and of how
many of the small divisions make one of the larger.&nbsp; But in
connection with the third Gift a new faculty is called forth--
Imagination-- and with it the instinct of construction is awakened."</span></span><span><span></span></span><br />
