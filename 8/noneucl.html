"Your
mind has been conditioned to Euclid," Holloway said. "So this-- thing--
bores us, and seems pointless. But a child knows nothing of Euclid. A
different sort of geometry from ours wouldn't impress him as being
illogical. He believes what he sees."<br />
      <br />
"Are you trying to tell me that this gadget's got a fourth dimensional
extension?" Paradine demanded.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
"Not
visually, anyway," Holloway denied. "All I say is that our minds,
conditioned to Euclid, can see nothing in this but an illogical tangle
of wires. But a child-- especially a baby-- might see more. Not at
first. It'd be a puzzle, of course. Only a child wouldn't be
handicapped by too many preconceived ideas."<br />
      <br />
"Hardening of the thought-arteries," Jane interjected.<br />
      <br />
Paradine
was not convinced. "Then a baby could work calculus better than
Einstein? No, I don't mean that. I can see your point, more or less
clearly. Only--"<br />
      <br />
"Well, look. Let's suppose there are two kinds
of geometry-- we'll limit it, for the sake of the example. Our kind,
Euclidean, and another, which we'll call x. X hasn't much relationship
to Euclid. It's based on different theorems. Two and two needn't equal
four in it; they could equal y, or they might not even equal. A baby's
mind is not yet conditioned, except by certain questionable factors of
heredity and environment. Start the infant on Euclid--"<br />
      <br />
"Poor kid," Jane said.<br />
      <br />
Holloway shot her a quick glance. "The <i>basis</i>
of Euclid. Alphabet blocks. Math, geometry, algebra-- they come much
later. We're familiar with that development. On the other hand, start
the baby with the basic principles of our x logic--"<br />
      <br />
      <b style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">"Blocks? What
kind?"<br />
      <br />
      </b>Holloway looked at the abacus. "It wouldn't make much sense
to us. But we've been conditioned to Euclid."<br />

<div align="left"><small>* I.e., <i>other than</i> Euclidean.
The phrase "non-Euclidean" is usually applied to only <i>some</i>
of the geometries that are not Euclidean. The geometry illustrated by
the blocks in question is not Euclidean, but is also, in the jargon
used by most mathematicians, not "<i>non</i>-Euclidean."</small>
