Brouwer (Ch. 14
(pp. 693-746) of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=XicsNQIrC3sC" target="_new"><i>Handbook

<br />
The Steiner system S(5, 8, 24) is a set S of 759 eight-element subsets
("octads") of a twenty-four-element set T such that any five-element
subset of T is
contained
in exactly one of the 759 octads. Its automorphism group is the
large Mathieu group M<sub><small>24</small></sub>.
<br />
<br />
Robert A. Wilson on R. T. Curtis:<br />
<br />
"One of his most important contributions is surely the invention of the
MOG (Miracle Octad Generator) for facilitating calculation in the
Mathieu group M<sub><small>24</small></sub>.
Before then, if you wanted
to generate
octads, you
had to look up the list of all 759 of them in a paper of Todd.
Afterwards, all the octads were drawn on a postcard (not quite a
postage-stamp!) and calculation became immeasurably easier. The MOG was
an essential ingredient in the constructions of J<sub><small>4</small></sub>
and the Monster, and
remains an indispensable tool for working in many of the sporadic
groups."<br />

Miracle Octad Generator (MOG) of R. T. Curtis<br />
("A new combinatorial approach to M<sub>24</sub>,"<br />
Math. Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc., 79 (1976), 25-42.) </p>
</center>
The MOG is a pairing of the 35 partitions of an 8-set into two 4-sets
with the 35 partitions of AG(4,2) (the affine 4-space over GF(2)) into
4 affine planes.&nbsp; The pairing preserves certain incidence
properties.&nbsp; It is used in studying the Steiner system S(5, 8,
24),
the large Mathieu group, the extended binary Golay code, the Leech
lattice, and subgroups of the Monster. <br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note:</span>
The above "pairing" of two 35-member sets is Curtis's original approach
to the MOG. Many sources now offer an alternate definition-- the MOG as
a rectangular array of 4 rows and 6 columns-- based on Conway's <span style="font-style: italic;">hexacode</span>. &nbsp;See "<a href="mogdefs.html">Competing Definitions of the Miracle Octad Generator</a>."<br /><br />
<center><span style="font-weight: bold;">History:</span>
<br />
<br />
</center>
This pairing, without illustrations,<small> </small>was described in
1910 by G. M. Conwell in "The 3-space PG(3,2) and
its group," Ann. of Math. 11 (1910) 60-76.<br />
<br />
The 35 square structures above apparently first appeared, without any
reference to their role in finite geometry, in the 1974 (published
1976) Curtis paper
mentioned above.<br />
<br />
The 35 square structures above were discovered independently in 1976 by
Steven H. Cullinane.&nbsp; The role they play in finite geometry
was
apparently first described by Cullinane in an AMS abstract in 1979 that
was received for publication on Oct. 31, 1978. The connection between
finite geometry and the square structures illustrated above was also
pointed out by Cullinane in a note, "<a href="../pg/dt/ortholatin.html">Orthogonal
Latin Squares as Skew Lines</a>," of December 1978.&nbsp;
(For related
material, see <a href="../gen/ortho.html">Latin-Square
Geometry</a>.)&nbsp;
The existence of the 35 combinatorially defined square structures of
Curtis was pointed out by Curtis to Cullinane in a personal
communication of March 1979.&nbsp; The connection between the
finite-geometry research of Conwell and the combinatorial research of
Curtis was apparently first pointed out in "<a href="gentheog2.html">Generating
the
Octad Generator</a>," a
note by Cullinane of April 28, 1985. <br />
<br />
Curtis uses the MOG to construct the Steiner system S(5, 8, 24), a
structure that goes back at least to Witt in 1938 and (Rotman,
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387942858/qid=1133379791/"><span style="font-style: italic;">An Introduction to the Theory of

to Carmichael in 1931.<br />

      <td valign="top">"The close relationships between
group theory
and structural combinatorics go back well over a century. Given a
combinatorial
object, it is natural to consider its automorphism group. Conversely,
given a group,
there may be a nice object upon which it acts. If the group is given as
a group of
permutations of some set, it is natural to try to regard the elements
of that set as
the points of some structure which can be at least partially
visualized.
For example, in 1861 Mathieu... discovered five multiply transitive
permutation groups. These were constructed as groups of permutations of
11, 12, 22, 23 or 24 points, by means of detailed calculations. In <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/2370885">a little-known
1931 paper</a> of Carmichael <b>[5]</b>, they were
first observed to
be automorphism groups of exquisite finite geometries. This fact was
rediscovered soon
afterwards by Witt <b>[11]</b>, who provided direct
constructions for
the groups
and then the geometries. It is now more customary to construct first
the
designs, and then the groups...."<br />

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Some geometric background on the MOG:</span><br />
<br />
From Vol. II of <i>Projective Geometry</i>, a 1918 classic
by Oswald
Veblen, a line of thought that may help to understand the construction
of the MOG:<br />
<blockquote>Excerpt from Chapter III, "The Affine Group in the
Plane"--<br />
  <br />
"The system of definitions and theorems which expose properties
invariant under a given group of transformations may be called, in
agreement with the point of view expounded in Klein's Erlangen
Programm,* a <i>geometry</i>.&nbsp; Obviously, all the
theorems of the
geometry corresponding to a given group continue to be theorems in the
geometry corresponding to any subgroup of the given group; and the more
restricted the group, the more figures will be distinct relatively to
it, and the more theorems will appear in the geometry.&nbsp; The
extreme case is the group corresponding to the identity, the geometry
of which is too large to be of consequence.<br />
  <br />
For our purposes we restrict attention to groups of projective
collineations,** and in order to get a more exact classification of
theorems we narrow the Kleinian definition by assigning to the geometry
corresponding to a given group only the theory of those properties
which, while invariant under this group, are <i>not invariant
under
any other group of projective collineations containing it</i>.&nbsp;
This will render the question definite as to whether a given theorem
belongs to a given geometry.<br />
  <br />
Perhaps the simplest example of a subgroup of the projective group in a
plane is the set of all projective collineations which leave a line of
the plane invariant.&nbsp; The present chapter is concerned chiefly
with the geometry belonging to this group."&nbsp; <br />
  <br />
* Cf. F. Klein, Vergleichende Betractungen uber neue geometrische
Forschungen, Erlangen 1872; also in Mathematische Annalen, Vol. XLIII
(1893), p. 63<br />
  <br />
** From some points of view it would have been desirable to include
also all projective groups containing correlations.<br />
</blockquote>
<p>The MOG may be regarded as summarizing a geometric structure
featuring 759 eight-sets ("octads") in a "space" of 24
points.&nbsp; The set of 759 octads is left invariant by the
transformations of the large
Mathieu group M<sub>24</sub>.&nbsp;
A subgroup, the octad stabilizer, leaves an octad invariant (as a set,
though not pointwise).&nbsp; It so happens that the octad
stabilizer,
which may be viewed as acting separately on the stabilized octad and on
the set of the remaining 16 points of the 24, is
isomorphic to the automorphism group of the affine 4-space over the
2-element field.&nbsp; (In fact, the two parts of this group's
action
illustrate the isomorphism of the alternating group on eight elements
with the general linear group acting on the 4-space over the 2-element
field; the stabilized octad is left fixed pointwise by the translations
of the affine 4-space.)&nbsp; A standard theorem of projective
geometry
says that we may adjoin to an affine n-space an (n-1)-dimensional
projective "hyperplane at infinity" to obtain a projective
n-space.&nbsp; The group of the geometry of the affine n-space is
the
subgroup of the group of the projective n-space leaving the "hyperplane
at infinity" invariant (as a set, not pointwise), as in Veblen's
discussion above.&nbsp; One might argue that a stabilized octad in
the
Mathieu geometry plays a role in some way analogous to that of a
"hyperplane at infinity." </p>
