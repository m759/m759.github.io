an aggregate of four theorems. See below.]</small> &nbsp;</span></big></p>


      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">[Notations for points: A, B,
C;&nbsp; A', B', C';&nbsp; P, Q, R]</span></span></p>


      
      <p><span>If two triads of points, A, B, C and A', B',
C', <br />


be such that the three joining lines AA', BB', CC' <br />


meet in one point, say O,<br />


then the two lines BC, B'C' meet, say in the point P, <br />


and similarly the lines CA, C'A' meet, say in Q, <br />


and the lines AB, A'B' meet, say in R, <br />


and the three points P, Q, R are in line. <br />


      <br />


Conversely, given two triads of points, A, B, C and A', B', C', <br />


such that the lines BC, B'C' intersect, say in P, <br />


that the lines CA, C'A' intersect, say in Q, <br />


and that the lines AB, A'B' intersect, say in R, <br />


while P, Q, R are in line, <br />


then the lines AA', BB', CC' cointersect.&nbsp;</span></p>


      
      <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">[PROOF]<br />


      </span><br />


It is supposed that the points A, B, C are not in line,&nbsp;<br />


so that they determine a plane, and similarly that A', B', C' determine
a plane.&nbsp;<br />


      </span></p>


      
      <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">[Case
1: Different planes]</span><br />


      <br />


Take first the case when these planes are different.&nbsp;</span></p>


      
      <p><span>Suppose further that no one of the joins BC,
CA,
AB is in the plane A'B'C', <br />


and no one of the joins B'C', C'A', A'B' is in the plane ABC. <br />


      <br />


Then the fact that the lines BB', CC' intersect <br />


involves that the points B, B', C, C' are in one plane, <br />


and hence that the lines BC, B'C' meet.&nbsp;</span></p>


      
      <p><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">[Definition
of points P, Q, R
]</span><br />


      <br />


Their point of intersection, say P,<br />


lies then on BC which is in the plane ABC, <br />


and on B'C' which is in the plane A'B' C', <br />


so that P lies on the line of intersection of these two planes. <br />


      <br />


The point, Q, of intersection of the lines CA, C'A', similarly found, <br />


as well as the point, R, of intersection of the lines AB, A'B', <br />


are equally on the line of intersection of the planes ABC, A'B'C'. <br />


      <br />


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">So that the former
statement made is clearly true.</span></span></p>


      
      <p><span> Conversely if the lines BC, B'C' meet in
the
point P, <br />


while CA, C'A' meet in Q and AB, A'B' meet in R, then, <br />


still assuming the planes ABC, A'B'C' to be different, <br />


and assuming that no one of the lines BC, B'C', CA, C'A', AB, A'B' <br />


is common to both planes, the points P, Q, R are evidently <br />


in the line of intersection of these planes.&nbsp;</span></p>


      
      <p><span>The fact that the lines BC, B'C' intersect,
involves that <br />


the lines BB' and CC' intersect, while similarly <br />


the line AA' intersects both of these.&nbsp;</span></p>


      
      <p><span>Now the lines BB', CC' determine a plane, <br />


and the line AA' does not lie in this plane, <br />


since we have assumed that the planes ABC, A'B'C' are different;<br />


wherefore the line AA' meets this plane in a point<br />


and can only intersect both BB' and CC' by passing through their<br />


      <span><br />


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Page 7:</span></span></span></p>


      
      <p><span><span>point of intersection.&nbsp;</span></span></p>


      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span>Thus
the lines AA', BB', CC' meet in a point, as we desired to
shew.&nbsp;</span></span></p>


      
      <p><span><span>We have explicitly excluded, for
the
sake of simplicity, <br />


the possibility of one of the six lines BC,... lying in both planes, <br />


which is easily seen to be unimportant.&nbsp;</span></span></p>


      
      <p><span><span>Incidentally we see that if
three
lines be <br />


such that every two of them have a common point,<br />


then the three lines lie all in one plane,<br />


or pass through one point.</span></span></p>


      
      <p><span><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">[Case
2: One plane]</span></span></span></p>


      
      <p><span><span> Next suppose the two triads A,
B, C
and A', B', C' to be in one plane, <br />


it being assumed as before that <br />


A, B, C are not in line and A', B', C' are not in line.&nbsp;</span></span></p>


      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span>[Definition
of points O, P, P']</span></span></p>


      
      <p><span><span>Then, first, let the lines AA',
BB',
CC' meet in one point, O.</span></span></p>


      
      <p><span><span> Draw through O any line not
lying in
the plane of the two triads, <br />


and let P, P' be any two points on this line.</span></span></p>


      
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span>[Definition
of &nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">points A", B", C"]</span><br />


      </span></span><br />


      <span><span>Then the intersecting lines AA'O and PP'O
determine a plane, <br />


and the lines AP, A'P', lying therein, intersect in a point, <span style="font-weight: bold;">say A"</span>. <br />


      <br />


Similarly the lines BP, B'P' meet in a point, <span style="font-weight: bold;">say B"</span>, <br />


and the lines CP, C'P' meet in a point, <span style="font-weight: bold;">say C"</span>. <br />


      <br />


As P is not in the plane of ABC, A'B'C', it is clear that<br />


the points A", B", C" are not in this plane; <br />


further A", B", C" are not in line, since otherwise, <br />


as the plane containing this line and P <br />


would contain the points A, B, C, these would be in line; <br />


      <br />


finally the plane which is thus determined by the points A", B", C" <br />


does not contain, for instance, the line AB,<br />


for otherwise the plane of AB and A"B", <br />


which contains P, would contain C" and C,<br />


and A, B, C would be in line. <br />


      </span></span></p>

      
      <p><span><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">[Definition of points L, M, N]</span></span></span><span><span></span></span></p>

      
      <p><span><span>
Hence it follows from what is proved above,<br />


as the lines AA", BB", CC" meet in P, <br />


that there is, in the plane of ABC and A'B'C', a line, <br />


where this plane is met by the plane A"B"C",<br />


and upon this line three points, say L, M and N, <br />


such that the lines BC, B"C" meet in L,<br />


the lines CA, C"A" meet in M <br />


and the lines AB, A"B" meet in N. <br />


      <br />


The point L is then the point where <br />


the plane of ABC and A'B'C' is met by the line B"C",<br />


and M, N are similarly the points where<br />


this plane is met by C"A" and A"B".<br />


      <br />


By considering that the three lines A'A", B'B", C'C" meet in the point
P', <br />


we prove however, in the same way, that B'C' passes through L,<br />


and that C'A', A'B' respectively pass through M and N. <br />


      <br />


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">We have thus proved</span>
      <br />


that if two triads of points ABC, A'B'C', in the same plane,<br />


be such that the joining lines AA', BB', CC' meet in a point, <br />


then the three points of intersection <br />


(BC, B'C'), (CA, C'A'), (AB,
A'B') are in line.<br />


      <br />


      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> Conversely,</span><br />


for two triads of points ABC, A'B'C' in the same plane, <br />


assume that the three points <br />


(BC, B'C'), (CA, C'A'), (AB, A'B') are in
line.&nbsp;</span></span></p>


      
      <p><span><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">[Definition of points L, M, N for the converse]</span><br />


      <br />


Denote these points respectively by L, M, N. <br />


      <br />


Draw through the line LMN a plane, <br />


other than the original plane of ABC, A'B'C';<br />


      <br />


draw through the points L, M, N, in this new plane, respectively <br />


the lines LB"C", MC"A", NA"B", giving by their intersections<br />


a further triad A", B", C" in this new plane. <br />


      <br />


This new plane does not contain any one of the lines BC, CA, AB, B'C',</span></span></p>


      
      <p><span><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Page
8:</span></span></span></p>


      

      
      <p><span><span><span>C'A', A'B', and it
is
supposed that the lines LB"C",&nbsp;MC''A", NA"B" <br />


are all drawn so as not to lie in the original plane of ABC, A'B'C'. <br />


      <br />


Then, as the lines BC, B"C" meet in the point L, <br />


the lines CA, C"A" meet in the point M, <br />


and the lines AB, A"B" meet in the point N,&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
      <p><span><span><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">[Definition of points O, P, P' for the converse]<br />
      </span></span></span></span><span><span><span>

      <br />


it follows from what has preceded that <br />


the three lines AA", BB', CC" meet in a point, say P, <br />


which does not lie in either the original plane or the new plane.<br />


      <br />


It follows similarly, as the lines B'C', B"C" meet in the point L,<br />


and C'A', C"A" in M, and A'B', A"B" in N, <br />


that the lines A'A'", B'B", C' C" meet in a point, say P',<br />


not lying in either of the two planes described. <br />


      </span></span></span></p>


      

      
      <p><span><span><span>Now let O be the
point where the line PP'<br />


meets the original plane of ABC, A'B'C'. <br />


      <br />


Then, since the lines AP, A'P' intersect, in the point A", <br />


and the points A, A', P, P' are not in line, these lines determine a
plane,<br />


and therefore the line AA' intersects the line PP'.<br />


      <br />


This intersection can only be at O, <br />


where the line PP' meets the original plane containing A and A'. <br />


Thus the line AA' passes through O,<br />


as, similarly, do also the lines
BB' and CC'. <br />


      <br />


      <span style="font-weight: bold;">We have thus proved</span>
that if two triads ABC, A'B'C', <br />


of points in one plane, neither triad being in line, <br />


be such as to have three intersections<br />


(BC, B'C'), (CA, C'A'), (AB, A'B') lying in line,<br />


then the three joining lines AA', BB', CC' meet in a point.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>


      
      <p style="font-weight: bold;"><span><span><span>The
aggregate of the
four
theorems now established <br />


will be referred to as Desargues' theorem.</span></span></span></p>
