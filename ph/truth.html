      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Plato's Beard
      versus Occam's Razor</font>
    </h2><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Richard J.
    Trudeau, in <i>The Non-Euclidean Revolution</i> (see above),
    opposes what he calls the Story Theory of truth [i.e., Quine,
    nominalism, postmodernism] to the traditional Diamond Theory
    of truth [i.e., Plato, realism, the Roman Catholic Church].
    This opposition goes back to the medieval "problem of
    universals" debated by scholastic philosophers. The following
    are some references on this topic.</font>

    not exist? Quine says, "This tangled doctrine might be
    nicknamed Plato's beard; historically it has proved tough,
    frequently dulling the edge of Occam's razor." (See Quine's

      Realism and the Problem of Universals:</font>
    </h3><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"It is said
    that the students of medieval Paris came to blows in the
    streets over the question of universals. The stakes are high,
    for at issue is our whole conception of our ability to
    describe the world truly or falsely, and the objectivity of
    any opinions we frame to ourselves. It is arguable that this
    is always the deepest, most profound problem of philosophy.
    It structures Plato's (realist) reaction to the sophists
    (nominalists). What is often called 'postmodernism' is really
    just nominalism, colourfully presented as the doctrine that
    there is nothing except texts. It is the variety of
    nominalism represented in many modern humanities, paralysing
    appeals to reason and truth."<br />

      spiritual world."<br />

      truths, for all their utility; or even probable truths,
      without which daily life would be impossible; but
      informative, certain truths, the only 'truths' strictly
      worthy of the name. Such truths I will call 'diamonds';
      they are highly desirable but hard to find....The happy
      metaphor is Morris Kline's in <i>Mathematics in Western
      Culture</i> (Oxford, 1953), p. 430."<br />

      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"A new
      epistemology is emerging to replace the Diamond Theory of
      truth. I will call it the 'Story Theory' of truth: There
      are no diamonds. People make up stories about what they
      experience. Stories that catch on are called 'true.' The
      Story Theory of truth is itself a story that is catching
      on. It is being told and retold, with increasing frequency,
      by thinkers of many stripes.... My own viewpoint is the
      Story Theory.... I concluded long ago that each enterprise
      contains only stories (which the scientists call 'models of
      reality'). I had started by hunting diamonds; I did find
      dazzlingly beautiful jewels, but always of human
      manufacture."<br />

    <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Trudeau's
      confusion seems to stem from the nominalism of W. V. Quine,
      which in turn stems from Quine's appalling ignorance of the
      nature of geometry. Quine thinks that the geometry of
      Euclid dealt with "an emphatically empirical subject
      matter" -- "surfaces, curves, and points in real space."
      Quine says that Euclidean geometry lost "its old status of
      mathematics with a subject matter" when Einstein
      established that space itself, as defined by the paths of
      light, is non-Euclidean. Having totally misunderstood the
      nature of the subject, Quine concludes that after Einstein,
      geometry has become "uninterpreted mathematics," which is
      "devoid not only of empirical content but of all question
      of truth and falsity." (<i>From Stimulus to Science</i>,
      Harvard University Press, 1995, page 55)<br />

    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The
      <i>correct</i> statement of the relation between geometry
      and the physical universe is as follows:</font>
    </p>
    <p>
      <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">"The contrast
      between pure and applied mathematics stands out most
      clearly, perhaps, in geometry. There is the science of pure
      geometry, in which there are many geometries: projective
      geometry, Euclidean geometry, non-Euclidean geometry, and
      so forth. Each of these geometries is a <i>model</i>, a
      pattern of ideas, and is to be judged by the interest and
      beauty of its particular pattern. It is a <i>map</i> or
      <i>picture</i>, the joint product of many hands, a partial
      and imperfect copy (yet exact so far as it extends) of a
      section of mathematical reality. But the point which is
      important to us now is this, that there is one thing at any
      rate of which pure geometries are <i>not</i> pictures, and
      that is the spatio-temporal reality of the physical world.
      It is obvious, surely, that they cannot be, since
      earthquakes and eclipses are not mathematical
      concepts."<br />

    John Keats's First and Second Laws of Aesthetics ('Beauty is

    Keats's ode itself, while denying this by precept, bears it

    intellectual sphere and beauty the aesthetic pole. Each is
    admirable in its way. The alethic pole exerts the main pull
    on science, in the broad sense: <i>Wissenschaft</i>,
    comprising mathematics, history, and all the hard and soft
