<div align="center">Quotations compiled by Steven H. Cullinane on April

<p><strong>From Ursula K. Le Guin's novel<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dispossessed"><em><br />
The Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopia</em></a> (1974)&#8212;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter One<br />
</strong></p>
<p>"There was a wall. It did not look important. It was built of uncut
rocks roughly mortared. An adult could look right over it, and even a
child could climb it. Where it crossed the roadway, instead of having a
gate it degenerated into mere geometry, a line, an idea of boundary.
But the idea was real. It was important. For seven generations there
had been nothing in the world more important than that wall.</p>
<p>Like all walls it was ambiguous, two-faced. What was inside it and
what was outside it depended upon which side of it you were on."</p>
<p><strong>Note&#8212;</strong></p>
<p>"We note that the phrase 'instead of having a gate it degenerated
into mere geometry' is mere fatuousness. If there is an idea here, <em>degenerate</em>,
<em>mere</em>, and <em>geometry&nbsp;</em> in concert do not fix it.
They bat at it like a kitten at a piece of loose thread."</p>
<p> &#8211; Samuel R. Delany, <em>The Jewel-Hinged Jaw: Notes on the
Language of Science Fiction</em>&nbsp; (Dragon Press, 1977), page 110
of revised edition, Wesleyan University Press, 2009</p>
<p>(For the phrase <em>mere geometry</em>&nbsp; elsewhere, see <a href="../gen/mere.html">a note of April 22</a>.
The

flat
figures in that note's illustration "Galois Affine
Geometry" may be regarded as <a href="../noindex/degenerateview.pdf"><em>degenerate</em></a>&nbsp;

<p><strong>Later in the Le Guin novel&#8212;</strong></p>
<p>"&#8230; The Terrans had been intellectual imperialists, jealous wall
builders. Even Ainsetain, the originator of the theory, had felt
compelled to give warning that his physics embraced no mode but the
physical and should not be taken as implying the metaphysical, the
philosophical, or the ethical. Which, of course, was superficially
true; and yet he had used <em>number</em>, the bridge between the
rational and the perceived, between psyche and matter, 'Number the
Indisputable,' as the ancient founders of the Noble Science had called
it. To employ mathematics in this sense was to employ the mode that
preceded and led to all other modes. Ainsetain had known that; with
endearing caution he had admitted that he believed his physics did,
indeed, describe reality.</p>
<p>Strangeness and familiarity: in every movement of the Terran's
thought Shevek caught this combination, was constantly intrigued. And
sympathetic: for Ainsetain, too, had been after a unifying field
theory. Having explained the force of gravity as a function of the
geometry of spacetime, he had sought to extend the synthesis to include
electromagnetic forces. He had not succeeded. Even during his lifetime,
and for many decades after his death, the physicists of his own world
had turned away from his effort and its failure, pursuing the
magnificent incoherences of quantum theory with its high technological
yields, at last concentrating on the technological mode so exclusively
as to arrive at a dead end, a catastrophic failure of imagination. Yet
their original intuition had been sound: at the point where they had
been, progress had lain in the indeterminacy which old Ainsetain had
refused to accept. And his refusal had been equally correct&#8211; in the
long run. Only he had lacked the tools to prove it&#8211; the Saeba variables
and the theories of infinite velocity and complex cause. His unified
field existed, in Cetian physics, but it existed on terms which he
might not have been willing to accept; for the velocity of light as a
limiting factor had been essential to his great theories. Both his
Theories of Relativity were as beautiful, as valid, and as useful as
ever after these centuries, and yet both depended upon a hypothesis
that could not be proved true and that could be and had been proved, in
certain circumstances, false.</p>
<p>But was not a theory of which all the elements were provably true a
simple tautology? In the region of the unprovable, or even the
disprovable, lay the only chance for breaking out of the circle and
going ahead.</p>
<p>In which case, did the unprovability of the hypothesis of real
coexistence&#8211; the problem which Shevek had been pounding his head
against desperately for these last three days. and indeed these last
ten years&#8211; really matter?</p>
<p>He had been groping and grabbing after certainty, as if it were
something he could possess. He had been demanding a security, a
guarantee, which is not granted, and which, if granted, would become a
prison. By simply assuming the validity of real coexistence he was left
free to use the lovely geometries of relativity; and then it would be
possible to go ahead. The next step was perfectly clear. The
coexistence of succession could be handled by a Saeban transformation
series; thus approached, successivity and presence offered no
antithesis at all. The fundamental unity of the Sequency and
Simultaneity points of view became plain; the concept of interval
served to connect the static and the dynamic aspect of the universe.
How could he have stared at reality for ten years and not seen it?
There would be no trouble at all in going on. Indeed he had already
gone on. He was there. He saw all that was to come in this first,
seemingly casual glimpse of the method, given him by his understanding
of a failure in the distant past. The wall was down. The vision was
both clear and whole. What he saw was simple, simpler than anything
else. It was simplicity: and contained in it all complexity, all
promise. It was revelation. It was the way clear, the way home, the
light."</p>
