ancient theory of music <br />
that we owe to the Pythagoreans, <br />
which is endorsed by Plato in the Timaeus <br />
and by Plotinus, St Augustine, and Boethius <br />
in their treatises on music, <br />
and which survives in Al-Farabi, in Aquinas, <br />
and even in such Renaissance theorists as Zarlino, <br />
is centred on the experience of harmony. <br />
Having noticed that
the elementary concords <br />
- octave, fifth, and fourth - <br />
are produced by strings whose lengths are proportioned <br />
according to perfect fractions, <br />
those writers concluded that <br />
our experience of music <br />
is an experience of number. <br />
Number, and
the relations of number, <br />
provide the hidden order of the
universe; <br />
and numbers are known through the intellect, <br />
and known with a certainty that pertains to no other thing. <br />
When understanding mathematics <br />
we have access to <br />
the order of
creation, <br />
and this order is eternal, <br />
like the numbers
themselves. <br />
In music we know through experience, <br />
and in time, <br />
what is also revealed to the intellect <br />
as outside time and
change. <br />
Just as time is, for Plato and Plotinus, <br />
the moving
image of eternity, <br />
so is the experience of music <br />
the revelation in time <br />
of the eternal order. <br />
The beauty of music
is the beauty of <br />
the world itself, <br />
revealed to the sense of
hearing - <br />
a 'point of intersection of the timeless with
time.'" <br />

following is an excerpt from Principles of Architecture, by Jorma
Manty (online). Manty is disussing terms used by Vitruvius (De
Architectura) and by St. Thomas Aquinas and James Joyce (Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man). </font>
      <p><font face="Times,serif" size="3"><b>TERMS USED BY VITRUVIUS:</b>
      <br />
      <b>Grace (Venustas):</b> When the appearance of the work shall be
pleasing and elegant, and the scale of the constituent parts is justly
calculated for symmetry.<br />
In addition to venustas, Vitruvius also
devises three principal aesthetic conceptions: eurythmia, symmetria,
and decor, and explains them as follows: <br />
      <b>Eurythmia</b> (Proportion) implies a graceful semblance, the
suitable display of details in their context. <br />
      <b>Symmetria</b> is the appropriate harmony arising out of the
details of the work itself; the correspondence of each given detail
among the separate details to the form of the design as a whole. <br />
      <b>Decor</b> demands a faultless ensemble of the details of the
composed work; a decor "obeys convention." <br />
(Vitruvius, On Architecture)</font></p>
      <p><font face="Times,serif" size="3"><b>TERMS USED BY AQUINAS AND
JOYCE:</b> <br />
This triad of aesthetic principles interestingly has something in
common with the three principles mentioned in the statement by St.
Thomas Aquinas: <br />
"AD PULCHRITUDINEM TRIA REQUIRUNTUR: <br />
INTEGRITAS, CONSONANTIA, CLARITAS." <br />
James Joyce translates it as: "Three things are needed for beauty:
wholeness, harmony and radiance" And he gives a more detailed
explanation of these three terms: <br />
      <b>Integritas:</b> "An esthetic image is presented to us either
in
space or in time. What is audible is presented in time, what is visible
is presented in space. But, temporal or spatial, the esthetic image is
first luminously apprehended as selfbounded and selfcontained upon the
immeasurable background of space or time which is not it. You apprehend
it as one thing. You see is as one whole. You apprehend its wholeness."
      <br />
      <b>Consonantia:</b> "Having first felt that its is one thing you
feel now that it is a thing. You apprehend it as a complex, multiple,
divisible, separable, made up of its parts, the result of its parts and
their sum, harmonious." <br />
      <b>Claritas:</b> "When you have apprehended it as one thing and
have then analysed it according to its form and apprehended it as a
thing you make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically
permissible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no other
thing. The radiance is the scholastic quidditas, the whatness of a
thing." <br />

not impossible to draw a fairly sharp dividing line <br />

and that of the responses of ordinary life. <br />
A far more difficult question arises if we try to distinguish it <br />
from the responses made by us to certain abstract mental constructions <br />
such as those of pure mathematics. <br />
Here I conceive the emotional states due to the apprehension of
relations <br />
may be extremely similar to those aroused by the esthetic apprehension.
      <br />
Perhaps the distinction lies in this, that in the case of works of art <br />
the whole end and purpose is found in the exact quality of the
emotional state, <br />
whereas in the case of mathematics the purpose is the <br />
constatation of the universal validity of the relations <br />
without regard to the quality of the emotion accompanying apprehension.

the orientation of faculties and attention in the two cases." <br />
